# Introduction

India's economy has been on a meteoric rise in recent years, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In 2014, when Modi took office, India was the 11th largest economy in the world. Today, it is the 5th largest economy.

There are a number of factors that have contributed to India's economic growth under Modi. These include:

* **Liberalization of the economy:** Modi has made significant reforms to the Indian economy, opening it up to foreign investment and trade. This has helped to attract investment and create jobs.
* **Infrastructure development:** Modi has invested heavily in infrastructure, such as roads, railways, and airports. This has helped to improve connectivity and boost economic activity.
* **Digitalization:** Modi has also made India a leader in digitalization. This has helped to connect businesses and consumers, and improve efficiency.
* **Reforms to the agricultural sector:** Modi has made reforms to the agricultural sector, which has helped to boost farmers' incomes.

As a result of these reforms, India's economy has grown at an average rate of 7% per year since 2014. This is one of the fastest growth rates in the world.

India is now on track to become a $5 trillion economy by 2025. This would make it the third largest economy in the world, after the United States and China.

Modi's economic policies have been praised by many economists and businesses. They argue that his reforms have created a more favorable environment for economic growth.

However, some critics argue that Modi's reforms have benefited the rich at the expense of the poor. They also argue that he has not done enough to address the issue of inequality.

Despite these criticisms, Modi's economic policies have been a major factor in India's rise as a global economic power.

**Key takeaways:**

* India's economy has grown rapidly under Modi government, from 11th to 5th largest in the world.
