**Q1: Who was Napoleon Bonaparte?**
A2: Napoleon Bonaparte was a French military and political leader during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Born in 1769 on the island of Corsica, he was sent to mainland France to study at a military academy. After receiving his commission, he got involved in the War of the First Coalition, leading several successful campaigns and rising through the ranks of the French military. He eventually became Emperor of the French, and his campaigns and reforms had a lasting impact on European and global history.
Napoleon is a fascinating personality and his life is truly an adventure-filled one. Born in the island of Corsica, in the town of Ajaccio, Napoleon was born to a father who fought against the French occupiers of the island. He was born in the year 1769, when Corsica was still Italian territory. 

**Q2:Tell about his overall life?**
A2: Due to his brilliance in mathematics and strategy, he was recommended to join the French Navy, the Royal Navy, or the French Army. He decided to join the French infantry-artillery division, and his initiation combat came during the Siege of Toulon. He used his Geometry knowledge to bring the artillery regiment up the Hill of Mauritius and threatened the Royal Navy, hence saving the French Revolution. This won him much fame and success in his career.  

In 1799, he foiled an insurrection in Paris, and was appointed in charge of the French Army of Italy. He invaded Italy and gained a lot of French territory back, and then went on an expedition to Egypt with the intention of cutting off the British trade routes to India. Despite some initial success, the French fleet was destroyed by the British Navy under Admiral Nelson.
In 1802, Napoleon re-established slavery in the French West Indies. After this was followed by a successful Haitain Rebellion, Napoleon did not want to be distracted by this and so sold a huge part of French territory in the present-day United States to the Americans, an event known as the Louisiana Purchase.

In 1804, he was proclaimed the Emperor of France and in 1805, he became the Emperor of Italy as well. However, his ambition caused him to overreach himself, and this led to his eventual demise.
