**Q1: What is World History?**
A1: World history is a fascinating topic that we should all learn more about. It involves studying the events, forces, factors, and influences that shape global events and end up affecting our day-to-day lives. It is more interesting than most fiction stories. 

**Q2: What is the Peloponnesian War?**
A2: The Peloponnesian War was fought between the city-states of Athens and Sparta in the 5th century BCE. Athens had a greater population and army, and they were powerful enough to form an alliance of city-states which posed a great threat to the Spartan alliance. This led to the Spartan traditional hegemonic power to preemptively strike Athens, leading to a war that lasted nearly three decades. Athens initially had a great deal of success, but the Spartans eventually prevailed with the help of the Persian Achaemenid Empire.

**Q3: What is the Thucydides Trap?**
A3: The Thucydides Trap is a term coined by historian Thucydides, who observed that when a new power emerges and threatens the hegemony of an existing great power, war is often inevitable. This term is currently used to analyze the US-China rivalry.
