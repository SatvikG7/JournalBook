**Q1: What is World History?**

**Q2: What is the Peloponnesian War?**
A2: The Peloponnesian War was fought between the city-states of Athens and Sparta in the 5th century BCE. Athens had a greater population and army, and they were powerful enough to form an alliance of city-states which posed a great threat to the Spartan alliance. This led to the Spartan traditional hegemonic power to preemptively strike Athens, leading to a war that lasted nearly three decades. Athens initially had a great deal of success, but the Spartans eventually prevailed with the help of the Persian Achaemenid Empire.

**Q3: What is the Thucydides Trap?**
